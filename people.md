## Miles Spathelf
*GIS Analyst III*

**email**: mospathelf@alaska.edu  
**website**: https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/  
**about me**: Spatial ecologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Currently intersted in ungulate movement corridors for guiding 
conservation with increasing interest in infrastructure development.   
**research**: I am working on developing state/regionwide movement models 
for primarily caribou and moose. I plan to build on the work of colleagues 
and teams I am on that have developed automated data collection servers 
for gps data and apply filtering metods for dealing qith faulty locations 
and timestamps. My desire is to have a product that can highlight animal 
movement corridors so that it may be considered for future development 
plans in the state.

## Augustus Snyder 
*Graduate Student in UAF Biological Sciences*

**email**: amsnyder7@alaska.edu
**about me**: I am a first year PhD student here at UAF in Kristin O'Brien's lab. 
Outside of the lab and classes, I really like cycling and making 
coffee & espresso. I'm beginning to get into climbing, and I hope to 
explore cross-country skiing in the near future! 

**research**: I will be working on a project involving the physiological response of Antarctic notothenioid fishes to hypoxia stress. Currently, I'm planning on first characterizing these fishes' response to hypoxia stress using NMR-based or Mass Spec-based 
metabolomics approaches. Next, I will be measuring the effect of hypoxia acclimation on the transcription factor HIF-1's target genes using RNA-seq methods and transcriptomics analyses. My third chapter is still a bit nebulous at this point in time, but I'm considering measuring the effect of hypoxia stress on isolated mitochondrial respiration in different tissues.
