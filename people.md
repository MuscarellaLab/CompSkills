## Hannah Woody
*Graduate Student in UAF Biological Sciences*

**email**: hlwoody@alaska.edu  
**website**: hlwoody@github.io  
**about me**: I am studying permafrost microbes!   
**research**: I am exploring the energy (carbon) limitations of bacteria in the permafrost. I am researching this to understand how the bacteria has adapted to cold conditions, and what effects this has on their gene regulation and functionality.

## Augustus Snyder 
*Graduate Student in UAF Biological Sciences*

**email**:   
**about me**: I am a first year PhD student here at UAF in 
Kristin O'Brien's lab. I will be working on a project involving the 
physiological response of Antarctic notothenioid fishes to hypoxia 
stress. Outside of the lab and classes, I really like cycling and making 
coffee & espresso. I'm beginning to get into climbing, and I hope to 
explore cross-country skiing in the near future!

## Kyoko Okano
Ph.D. student
kokano@alaska.edu
about me: struggling but exciting to learn computulational skills! 
**research**
The Arctic becomes warmer nearly four times as fast as the rest of the world. My study focuses on how this rapid warming affects environments and ecology and how the changes affect carbon balance.
