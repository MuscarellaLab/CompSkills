+ about me: I am a hair-covered biped native to a small rocky planet with a liquid-dominant water 
cycle. My favorite activities are consuming nutrients and respiring oxygen to sustain my cellular 
activity.

# Learners

## Caitlyn Oliver Brown
*Graduate Curatorial Assistant*  

**email**: coliverbrown@alaska.edu  
**website**: coliverbrown@github.io  
**about me**: I like birds.  
**research**: I am studying gene flow and divergence of closely related avian lineages at high and low latitudes.

## Miles Spathelf
*GIS Analyst III*

**email**: mospathelf@alaska.edu  
**website**: https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/  
**about me**: Spatial ecologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Currently intersted in ungulate movement corridors for guiding 
conservation with increasing interest in infrastructure development.   
**research**: I am working on developing state/regionwide movement models 
for primarily caribou and moose. I plan to build on the work of colleagues 
and teams I am on that have developed automated data collection servers 
for gps data and apply filtering metods for dealing qith faulty locations 
and timestamps. My desire is to have a product that can highlight animal 
movement corridors so that it may be considered for future development 
plans in the state.

## Augustus Snyder 
*Graduate Student in UAF Biological Sciences*

**email**: amsnyder7@alaska.edu
**about me**: I am a first year PhD student here at UAF in Kristin O'Brien's lab. 
Outside of the lab and classes, I really like cycling and making 
coffee & espresso. I'm beginning to get into climbing, and I hope to 
explore cross-country skiing in the near future! 

**research**: I will be working on a project involving the physiological response of Antarctic notothenioid fishes to hypoxia stress. Currently, I'm planning on first characterizing these fishes' response to hypoxia stress using NMR-based or Mass Spec-based 
metabolomics approaches. Next, I will be measuring the effect of hypoxia acclimation on the transcription factor HIF-1's target genes using RNA-seq methods and transcriptomics analyses. My third chapter is still a bit nebulous at this point in time, but I'm considering measuring the effect of hypoxia stress on isolated mitochondrial respiration in different tissues.

## Kyoko Okano
Ph.D. student
kokano@alaska.edu
about me: struggling but exciting to learn computulational skills! 
**research**
The Arctic becomes warmer nearly four times as fast as the rest of the world. My study focuses on how this rapid warming affects environments and ecology and how the changes affect carbon balance.

## Noelle Picard 
*Student*

<<<<<<< HEAD
**email**: napicard@alaska.edu    
**about me**: I am a first year graduate student in the Wildlife Biology program and am completely new to computing, but it's cool to learn!     
**research**: I work in the lab of Kristin O'Brien and I am studying gill remodeling in Antarctic notothenioids. I plan to see if they are able to increase their surface area in their gills when exposed to hypoxia and I want to study the mechanism behind it.
